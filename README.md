# pds_project_challengers
We  used Google colab to run the code.
In this project we used 4 datasets and 3 statistical Imputation methods and 4 Machine Learning algorithms.

# Dataset
The datstets are collected from kaggle and data world.
Names of the datasets are mammographic_masses.data,ParisHousingClass, riceClassification, and cancer patient data sets - data world.

# Imputation Methods
The statistical methods are imported from sklearn
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer
From SimpleImputer we used mean, median, and mode imputation methods.
From KNNImputer we used KNN imputation method

# Machine Learning Algorithms
We used 4 machine Learning Algorithms
1.Logistic Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
2.Support vector Machine
from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier
3.Navie Bayes Classifier
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
4.Decision Tree Classification
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

The above mentioned libraries are imported and used for the project execution
Accuracy and Confusion matrix of the every algorithm is produced

# Code Execution
